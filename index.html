        <h1>Photocard Buying, Selling,<br> and Trading</h1>
        
        <p>To start your trading account provide the user with general information so people can understand how you will run your account. Some basic practices people in the buying, selling, and trading community include 1) being prepared to send out your trade before you are sent yours, this may be because you do not have a lot of proofs, 2) sending video proof of photocard(s), that includes a view of the front and back with flash 3) include your username and the username of the person you are sending to. When trading cards, the condition of the card can be checked before the transaction occurs. If your offer has minor dents/ scratches, some people may still be willing to trade, and others may not. After confirmation of the transaction, usually, a packing proof (e.g., the image of the card and address on the front of the envelope) will be sent to the sender to confirm that the address is correct. Some people might not be comfortable with their username on the envelope so please check with the person before writing it on the envelope. If they are comfortable when mailing out the photocard take a video showing the username on the envelope and send it to the person you are trading the card with to provide them additional proof that the card was mailed. Once the photocard is received let the person know that you received it and send them a picture of the photocard proving you got it.</p>

        <h1>Pack A Trade</h1>
        
        <p>The most preferred way to pack a trade is using a plastic sleeve over the photocard to protect it. Sometimes people will double sleeve it; one that fits tighter to the card and then another that is a bit bigger than the first sleeve. After the sleeve, it can be placed into a top loader or a shipping shield. Then either place the photocard into a bubble mailer or taped to a card and place the card inside an envelope.</p>
